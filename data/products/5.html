		<h2>Unique in the industry.</h2>
		<p>The Company® OMNIBEND® Fiber is composed of proprietary expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) with specific engineered physical qualities.  The fiber acts as a durable dry barrier to abrasion, reducing friction and elevated temperatures normally caused by friction.  This technology also enhances the performance of custom coatings.  The result: The Company® OMNIBEND® Fiber can vastly increase a rope's service life and reliability.</p>
		<h2>The best products and the best people, dedicated to quality.</h2>
		<p>Like all The Company products, The Company® OMNIBEND® Fiber is backed by a history of innovation and research supported by a worldwide service organization.  Let us work with you to enhance the performance and life of your high-tension synthetic rope designs.  Contact us to learn more.
